# leofcoin-core
> A Javascript based blockchain

## Introduction
Easy to use library containing our blockchain & some other handy dandy.

## Features 
- Fast block times 10 seconds or faster when network is under load (more info soon)
- DynamicSeedNodes so everyone can run a "masternode" (less payout then static node) (wip, LIP)
- Fast Sync (Get started "almost" in an instant) (dagchain)
- DDOS proof services

## Info
Hardcoded to the Olivia (testnet) network untill further notice or even offial release.

## Developers
### Packaging core for browser
When using core in the browser we need to package it with browserify, 
this will give us a file containing our code with all the dependencies inline.

#### Trigger build & package nodes for browser.
```sh
npm run package
```
you can also package modules manually
```sh
browserify lib/wallet.js --standalone CryptoWallet > lib/browser/wallet.js
```

*** Note that some packages require extra steps for when a user want to run local without a web server, this is accomplished by inserting the code in a html script tag. ***

### Building core for node
```sh
npm run build
```

### Serving
```sh
npm run start
```
